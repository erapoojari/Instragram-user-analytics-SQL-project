 Project Description >
 This project aims to perform marketing and investor analysis using an Instagram-like
 platform's database. The goal is to provide actionable insights such as identifying loyal
 users, inactive users, contest winners, popular hashtags, and more. The tasks also extend to
 analysing metrics that can help investors gauge user engagement and the prevalence of
 bots on the platform. SQL queries will be used to extract this information from a
 pre-configured database

  MySQL Workbench (Version: 8.0): I chose this tool due to its user-friendly interface and
 efficient execution of SQL queries. It supports the visualization of data relationships through
 ERdiagrams, which helps in better understanding the schema.
 MySQL Database: MySQL is a powerful open-source relational database management
 system that allows for the efficient handling of structured data and complex queries.
